1. Initialize .NET 8 console application for Martian Robots

2. Implement initial Robot and World classes with basic movement logic

3. Add scent tracking and off-grid detection to Robot and World

4. Implement console input/output flow - Build Program.cs with interactive input for grid, robot start, and instructions

5. Add validation for grid size, robot start position, and instruction characters

6. Enforce max coordinate limit (50) and max instruction length (100 chars)

7. Extract input validation into dedicated helper methods to simplify Program.cs

8. Introduce InputValidator class - Move validation helpers into InputValidator class to keep Program.cs file clean and structured

9. Add xUnit test project and initial test structure

10. Add tests for Robot movement, turning, scent logic, and LOST behaviour

11. Improve naming, simplify switch expressions, and clean up minor code smells

13. Add README with instructions, architecture overview, and problem explanation and running instuction

14. Expand README to include validation rationale and xUnit testing strategy

15. Could have added tests suite for InputValidator (grid, start position, instructions) but running out of time.
